## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r loading the data, echo = TRUE}
activity <- unzip("./activity.zip")
actData <- read.csv(activity, sep = ",")
str(actData)
```

```{r Process/transform the data into a format suitable for analysis}
meanSteps_allDays <- tapply(actData$steps, actData$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
stepsInterval <- data.frame(interval = as.numeric(as.character(names(meanSteps_allDays))), steps = as.vector(meanSteps_allDays))
totalStepsPerD1 <- tapply(actData$steps, actData$date, sum)
stepsPerday1 <- data.frame(date = names(totalStepsPerD1), steps = as.vector(totalStepsPerD1))
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = stepsPerday1, aes(x = steps))+
        geom_histogram()
```

```{r calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day, echo = TRUE}
meanTotalStep <- with(stepsPerday1, mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
medianTotalStep <- with(stepsPerday1, median(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
print(c(paste("mean total number of steps:", meanTotalStep), paste("median total number of steps:", medianTotalStep)))
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r make a time series plot of the 5-minute interval and the average number of steps taken averaged across all days, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = stepsInterval, aes(x = interval, y = steps))+
        geom_line()+
        labs(y = "average steps across all days")
```
![](https://github.com/younglogos/RepData_PeerAssessment1/blob/master/figure/time_series1.png)

```{r which 5-minute interval(on average across all the days)contains the maximum number of steps, echo = TRUE}
interval_maxSteps <- stepsInterval$interval[which(stepsInterval$steps == max(stepsInterval$steps))]
print(paste("interval with the max steps averaged across all days:",interval_maxSteps))
```

## Imputing missing values
```{r Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset, echo = TRUE}
totalMiss <- sum(is.na(actData))
print(paste("total number of missing values:", totalMiss))
```

```{r devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset and create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in, echo = TRUE}
fillData <- actData
missInd <- which(is.na(actData$steps))
IndInertval <- actData$interval[missInd]
fillData$steps[missInd] <- stepsInterval$steps[which(stepsInterval$interval == IndInertval)]
totalStepsPerD2 <- tapply(fillData$steps, fillData$date, sum)
stepsPerday2 <- data.frame(date = names(totalStepsPerD2), steps = as.vector(totalStepsPerD2))
str(fillData)
```

```{r make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = stepsPerday2, aes(x = steps))+
        geom_histogram()
```
![](https://github.com/younglogos/RepData_PeerAssessment1/blob/master/figure/histogram2.png)

```{r calculate the mean and median total number of steps, echo = TRUE}
meanFillTotalStep <- with(stepsPerday2, mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
medianFillTotalStep <- with(stepsPerday2, median(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
print(c(paste("mean total number of steps after filling in missing values:", meanFillTotalStep), paste("median total number of steps after filling in missing values:", medianFillTotalStep)))
```

There is no significant difference on mean and median compared with first part of assignment. It indicated that there was little impact of imputing missing data.


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{r Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels "weekday" and "weekend", echo = TRUE}
library(dplyr)
fillData["week"] <- weekdays(as.Date(fillData$date))
fillData$week[fillData$week != "星期六" & fillData$week != "星期日"] <- "weekday"
fillData$week[fillData$week == "星期六" | fillData$week == "星期日"] <- "weekend"
fillData$week <- as.factor(fillData$week)
weekdaySteps <- with(subset(fillData, week == "weekday"), tapply(steps,interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE))
weekendSteps <- with(subset(fillData, week == "weekend"), tapply(steps,interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE))
weekdayMeanSteps <- data.frame(interval = as.numeric(as.character(names(weekdaySteps))), steps = as.vector(weekdaySteps), week = rep("weekday", dim(weekdaySteps)[1]))
weekendMeanSteps <- data.frame(interval = as.numeric(as.character(names(weekendSteps))), steps = as.vector(weekendSteps), week = rep("weekend", dim(weekendSteps)[1]))
weekMeanSteps <- rbind(weekdayMeanSteps, weekendMeanSteps)
str(fillData$week)
```


```{r make a time series plot of the the average number of steps averaged across all weekday days or weekend days, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = weekMeanSteps, aes(x = interval, y = steps))+
  geom_line()+
  facet_grid(.~week)+
  labs(y = "average steps across all weekdays or weekends")
```
